HOW TO SET UP THE PROJECT:
1. Download and set up Android Studio.
2. Under "Device Manager" in the top right, select "Create device" and go through the 
   process of setting up an emulator.
	-Alternatively, you can connect a physical Android device to your computer
3. Unzip the zipped ProxyPal file.
4. Move the unzipped file somewhere that is easy to find; you will be opening this unzipped file from inside
   Android Studio.
5. In the top left of Android Studio, click "File". Then click "Open". Look for the unzipped ProxyPal file.
   It should have a green Android icon directly to the left of the file name; this indicates that the file
   is an Android Studio project. Click on the file, then click "OK" at the bottom.
6. At the top right, click on the green triangle that says "Run ..." when you hover over it.
7. The emulator should boot and the project should run; if this is your first time using Android Studio/running the
   emulator, etc., the initialization process for the emulator setting itself up may take awhile, maybe even up to 
   a few mintues.

from a business owner's side, and another is an example Supporter account for viewing things from the Supporter/Consumer
side. The information for both accounts is provided here if you wish to use them; you can log in as either of these 
accounts, or you can create an account if you wish.
